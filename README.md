# responsive-website
The most advanced responsive website I've made so far :-)
Going through the tutorial I learnt a lot, such as:
- using classes (and pseudo-classes) more fluently,
- transform property,
- animation property,
- using variables,
- great exercise with flexbox and grid,
- practice with media queries (mobile first! :-)),
- I love animations in this project! :-)
